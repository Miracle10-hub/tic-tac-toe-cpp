# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

This is a small C++ project I made to practice arrays, functions, and basic game logic.
It is written in a simple, human style so that anyone reading the code (including job recruiters)
can tell it's a student project and see what I learned.

## Features
- Two-player (X vs O) mode
- Play vs Computer (simple AI: win/block/center/corner/random)
- Terminal interface
- Replay games easily

## How to run

Make sure you have **g++** installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-cpp.git
cd tic-tac-toe-cpp
make
./tictactoe
```

Or compile manually:

```bash
g++ src/tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
./tictactoe
```

## What I learned
- 2D arrays in C++
- Breaking problems into functions
- Simple AI decision-making
- User input validation and loops

## TODO / Future improvements
- Add a GUI with SFML or SDL
- Implement minimax for a strong AI
- Save scores to a file
- Add unit tests
